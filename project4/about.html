        <section id="para">
        <p>Team Rocket is a team of people in pursuit of <s>evil and the exploitation of</s> Pokémon. We are based in the Kanto and Johto regions, with a small outpost in the Sevii Islands. While our main focus is <s>stealing</s> or capturing rare and strong Pokémon, and subsequently selling them, we also fund and conduct <s>cruel</s> experimental research on Pokémon. Our oath, as posted on the wall of one of our many bases, is "Steal Pokémon for profit. Exploit Pokémon for profit. All Pokémon exist for the glory of Team Rocket." Our ultimate goal is to take over the world using Pokémon.</p>
        <p>Giovanni is the leader of Team Rocket, as well as the secretive Gym Leader of Viridian City's Gym, known officially as the Viridian Gym. As a Gym Leader, he specialized in Ground-type Pokémon, but his master plan includes collecting rare Pokémon of all types.</p>
